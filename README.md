# GIPHY API

## Description
```bash
1. This application is using GIPHY API to create a dynamic web page and populate it with
gifs topics.

2. When the user clicks on a button of a particular topic, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

3. This app also can take in the value from a user. And then make a function call that takes each topic and remakes the buttons on the page.


4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, gif stop playing.

```
